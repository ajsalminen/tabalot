# Tabalot

Google Chrome Browser Extension to keep a limit on your open tabs.

## Usage

Click the badge icon to set your maximum number of tabs. The badge displays the
current number of open tabs (not counting pinned tabs). As you open more tabs
the badge count background gets more red as it nears your limit (which you set
by clicking the badge). When your tab limit is reached, the tab count number flashes.
Once the limit is exceeded, the Tabalot badge flashes red and Tabalot will
close the left-hand most tab (unless that tab was just opened or was used to
open a new tab by command clicking a link in it).
